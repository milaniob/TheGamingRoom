# TheGamingRoom

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Client is a company called The Gaming Room. They have created a game app called Draw it or Lose it for Android devices. The Game Draw it or Lose it is loosely similar to the 1980s television game _Win, Lose or Draw_. The goal is for teams to compete to guess what is image is being drawn. The company is asking us to help transfer this game to other platforms. So the goal is to get to all operating systems in the quickest and most efficient way. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I think I did a good job in explaning the correct process to start the integration to new platforms. I think it is important to make sure the easiest operating systems to transfer to were first. That way new users could get in quicker, debugging could happen sooner, and to take some work off the table. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  The UML Diagram is very helpful with developing the code. It outlines exactly what the structure was and then adding the new methods into the UML made it easy to see where they need to be and call to in the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I think I could have done a better job with my Recommendations at the end of the Design paper. I would need to improve it by just adding and embellish on some of the details of each point. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The users needs were pretty simple. I interpreted them easily and it was easy to add them into the code. Its important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the real reason for the code. The other important factor for the company is that you increase the amount of users in your user base if you can appeal to more people's needs. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  The approach to the software design was made easier with the comments that showed exactly where and what was needed. I think a great strategy to learn from this is structuring and outlining your code before you do it. A proper plan of action with comments for yourself can make the programing process easier and quicker.
